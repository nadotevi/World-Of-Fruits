        <h2>The Nutritional Powerhouse: Bananas Unveiled</h2>
        <p>
           Bananas are known for being a convenient and portable snack,
		   but they are also a nutritional powerhouse. Packed with essential
		   vitamins and minerals, bananas offer a wide array of health benefits.
		   Here are some key nutritional highlights:
        </p>

        <ol>
			<li><strong>Rich in Potassium:</strong> Bananas are famous for their potassium content,
			a crucial mineral for maintaining proper heart and muscle function. Adequate potassium intake
			helps regulate blood pressure and reduce the risk of stroke.</li>
			
			<li><strong>High in Vitamin C:</strong> Bananas contain vitamin C, an antioxidant that boosts
			the immune system and promotes healthy skin. This vitamin also aids in the absorption of iron,
			contributing to overall well-being.</li>
			
			<li><strong>Good Source of Dietary Fiber:</strong> Fiber is essential for digestive health,
			and bananas provide a good dose of both soluble and insoluble fiber. This can aid in maintaining
			a healthy weight and preventing constipation.</li>
			
			<li><strong>Natural Energy Boost:</strong> Bananas are an excellent source of natural sugars,
			particularly glucose, fructose, and sucrose. This makes them a quick and efficient energy source,
			making them an ideal snack before or after a workout.</li>
